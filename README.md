Returned to coding in order to help teach my kids, got hooked via FooBar, fell in love with python, now experimenting with exposing rust to python. My current project is documenting a full-stack walk-through of the eco-system at [FizzBuzz: combining rust & python](https://musicalninjadad.github.io/FizzBuzz). 

In my day job I help technical people be happy at work (or try to, at least...)

I like using languages idiomatically; clean, readable code; TDD; pipelines, etc...
I'm passionate about technical frameworks, so that's where I enjoy investing my time.

```python
for language in otherlanguages:
    assert python is not language #yes it's technically backwards for good assert logic ...
```

You'll still find some of my work on https://dev.azure.com/MusicalNinjas ...
I'm slowly moving it all to GitHub and adding documentation pages
