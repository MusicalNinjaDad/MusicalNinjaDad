I'm here for the fun of coding.

**If you find something you like or are interested in - @-tag me to get my attention.**

Current language preferences:
- python
- rust

Up for learning new ones (maybe golang next?)

Things I've _enjoyed_ coding in the past:
- Basic (late 80's)
- C
- x86 assembler (back in the days of the 386 & 486 processors)
- Fortran
- HTML, php, perl (when you would still write websites in notepad)
- Matlab

Things I actively dislike coding:
- Java
- JavaScript

I prefer the style of Kent Beck to Uncle Bob.

You'll find me creating test frameworks, coding helpers, automation tools - things used by devs (ideally by devs who make things used by devs)
- [pyo3-testing](https://github.com/MusicalNinjas/pyo3-testing) (for testing rust bindings destined for python)
- [pytest-doctest-mkdocstrings](https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/pytest-doctest-mkdocstrings) (for those who like to enclose their python docstring code examples in markdown backticks) naming stuff is hard!
- [pytest-ipynb2](https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/pytest-ipynb2) (if you want to have tests within your ipython notebooks and run them in your IDE/CI)
- [cibuildwheel-rust](https://github.com/MusicalNinjas/cibuildwheel-rust) (to speed up the creation of python packages using rust code)
- [pyo3-stubgen](https://github.com/MusicalNinjas/pyo3-stubgen) (so you get in-IDE documentation, type-checking etc.)

Or just generally messing around with code for fun or to help with other hobbies:
- [FizzBuzz](https://musicalninjadad.github.io/FizzBuzz/) - well because how else do you learn a new language?
- [ttrpg-dice](https://github.com/MusicalNinjaDad/ttrpg-dice) - I play warhammer with my kids
