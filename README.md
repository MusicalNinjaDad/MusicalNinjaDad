Recently returned to coding in order to help teach my kids. Got hooked via FooBar, fell in love with python.

I like using languages idiomatically; clean, readable code; TDD; pipelines, etc...
Previously, I prefered Matlab and Fortran to Java or C - go figure!

```python
for language in otherlanguages:
    assert python is not language #yes it's technically backwards for good assert logic ...
```

You'll find most of my work on https://dev.azure.com/MusicalNinjas ...
GitHub is where I put repos which may attract a larger contributor following or receive public issues & requests
